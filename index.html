		  <h1>About Me</h1>
		    <p><small>Welcome! My name is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTKdHbiLim0#t=0m20s">Tim!</a> I am a recent college graduate and aspiring Web Developer. I am currently enrolled in a 12-week Immersive Web Development course at General Assembly. My prime directive is to land a job as a junior web developer and surround myself with bright, industrious folk. When I'm not in the matrix I like to pursue: martial arts, gymnastics, climbing and cooking; writing, lucid dreaming and design. This coverphoto was taken on a climbing trip to Indian Creek, Utah over Thanksgiving Break 2013. (That's me on the right in the black jacket!)<br>Godspeed,<br><a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTl762MuXyc#t=0m20s">Timmay!</a></small>   </p>
